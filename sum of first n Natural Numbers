\\Write a program to find the sum of first n Natural Numbers Positive integers such as 1, 2, 3…… n is known as natural numbers using for loop also print negine number series of number 1 to 100.
\\Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main() { 

	int sum=0;
	int num;
	cout<<"Enter number:";
	cin>> num;

	for(int i=0; i<=num;i=i++)	
	{
	sum=sum+i;
	
	}
	cout<<"The total is: "<<sum<<endl;
	cout<<endl;
	system("pause");

}
