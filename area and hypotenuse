\\Write a C++ program that prompt user to enter value of X and Y.
\\You have to calculate the value of Hypotenuse (h) and Area(a).
\\Hypotenuse can be calculated using the following formula:				h = √x^2 + y^2
\\Area of this right-angled triangle can also be calculated using the following formula: a = ½ * x * y
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
void main() {
	
	float x,y;
	cout << "\nEnter the value of x = ";
	cin >>x;
	cout << "Enter the value of y = ";
	cin >>y;
    float area = 0.5*x*y;
	cout << "\nArea of right angle triangle = " << area;
    float hypo = sqrtf((x*x)+(y*y));
	cout << "\nHypothesis of right angle traingle = " <<hypo <<endl;
    system("pause");
}
