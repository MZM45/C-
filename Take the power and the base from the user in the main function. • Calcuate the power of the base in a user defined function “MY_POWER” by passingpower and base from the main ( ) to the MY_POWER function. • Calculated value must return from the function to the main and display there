Take the power and the base from the user in the main function. • Calcuate the power of the base in a user defined function “MY_POWER” by passingpower and base from the main ( ) to the MY_POWER function. • Calculated value must return from the function to the main and display there
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int power(int& a, int& b)
{
int power2;
power2 = pow(b, a);
cout << "The result of power "<<a<<" for base "<<b<<" is " << power2 << endl;
return power2;
}
void main()
{
int a, b;
cout << "Enter the power :";
cin >> a;
cout << "\nEnter the base :";
cin >> b;
power(a, b);
system("pause");
}
